# Recommendation system using correlatoin
In this project I used correlation method to suggest movie to watch based on movie which you just watched. This system suggest the movie similar to movie you watched by calculating correlation between the ratings given by all users of previously watched movie and ratings of all the other movies.

The correlation is a numerical values between -1 and 1 that indicates how much two variables are related to each other. Correlation = 0 means no correlation, while >0 is positive correlation and <0 is negative correlation.

In my model I used the item based because I considerd that a user based system could be influenced by the change of film taste in the time by people and also because having less films than items, will fasten calculations.
